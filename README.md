# Harmony Hub API: A Comprehensive Music Management Backend üéµ

Welcome to the **Harmony Hub API**, a robust and scalable backend designed to power your next digital music ecosystem. This project provides a complete set of RESTful endpoints for user authentication, music content management, and rich data interaction, built with a focus on efficiency and data integrity.

From managing user accounts to handling song uploads and creating intricate data models for artists, albums, playlists, and more, Harmony Hub API lays the groundwork for a sophisticated music platform. It's crafted to serve as the core engine for various front-end applications, enabling seamless interaction with a structured music database.

## üöÄ Usage

This project functions as a backend API. To interact with it, you'll send HTTP requests to its various endpoints. Below are detailed instructions and examples for key operations.

### Initial Setup

Before making API calls, ensure your environment is set up:

1.  **Environment Configuration**: Create a `.env` file in the project root based on the `db.php` requirements. This file should define your PostgreSQL database connection details:
    ```
    DB_HOST=your_database_host
    DB_PORT=5432
    DB_NAME=your_database_name
    DB_USER=your_database_user
    DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
    ```
2.  **Database Schema Creation**: Execute the `query.php` file once to set up all necessary database tables and their relationships. This script will create tables for users, artists, albums, music, playlists, and more.
    ```bash
    php query.php
    ```
    You should see a "Connected successfully to remote PostgreSQL!" message from `db.php` if your `.env` is correct, followed by "All tables created successfully with extras!" from `query.php`.

### API Endpoints

All API endpoints expect and return JSON, unless otherwise specified (e.g., file uploads). Authentication is handled via a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header for protected routes.

#### üîê User Authentication

*   **Sign Up a New User**
    *   `POST /signup.php`
    *   **Body (JSON)**:
